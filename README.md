# TOGAF-9.2-Acme-Enterprise
Collaborative Sanbox Implementation TOGAF Standard

<h3>Background Story</h3>
Acme Enterprise is a startup company operating an online retail business. They sell products through online marketplace platforms that offer API integration. Their current customer base consists of buyers who purchase products on these marketplace platforms. Acme sources and sells products from multiple suppliers, relying on semi-real-time stock information.

</p>
As their business continues to grow, the owner aims to expand operations by creating a system that allows new suppliers to easily register. These suppliers should be able to add their products for sale, update stock levels and prices conveniently. Additionally, the system should facilitate the efficient management of product delivery directly from designated warehouses.

</p>
The owner of Acme Enterprise is also a visionary entrepreneur who believes that it would be beneficial for society if the system can accommodate new and existing online retailers to expand their product offerings. She envisions that the new Acme system will provide an easy connection to new suppliers, fostering growth opportunities for all participants in the online retail ecosystem.

</p>
Following up the owner vision, John the lead System Architect proactively started to build Enterprise Architecture in collaborative way to address the new business goal. He choose to use TOGAF 9.2 Standard as framework to work with.
