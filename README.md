# TOGAF-9.2-Acme-Enterprise
Collaborative Sanbox Implementation TOGAF Standard

<h3>Background Story</h3>
Acme Enterprise is a startup company operating an online retail business. They sell products through online marketplace platforms that offer API integration. Their current customer base consists of buyers who purchase products on these marketplace platforms. Acme sources and sells products from multiple suppliers, relying on semi-real-time stock information.

</p>
As their business continues to grow, the owner aims to expand operations by creating a system that allows new suppliers to easily register. These suppliers should be able to add their products for sale, update stock levels and prices conveniently. Additionally, the system should facilitate the efficient management of product delivery directly from designated warehouses.

</p>
The owner of Acme Enterprise is also a visionary entrepreneur who believes that it would be beneficial for society if the system can accommodate new and existing online retailers to start or expand their product offerings. She envisions that the new Acme system will provide an easy connection to new suppliers, fostering growth opportunities for all participants in the online retail ecosystem.

</p>
To bring this vision to life, John, the lead architect, has proactively initiated the development of an Enterprise Architecture. He has chosen to utilize the TOGAF 9.2 Standard as the framework for this collaborative effort.
